# Node APIs (EVM)

## Summary
Core JSON-RPC and WebSocket APIs for EVM chains via Alchemy node endpoints, plus Debug/Trace and utility methods.

## References (Recommended Order)
1. [json-rpc.md](references/json-rpc.md) - Standard JSON-RPC methods and endpoint patterns.
2. [websocket-subscriptions.md](references/websocket-subscriptions.md) - Real-time subscriptions (pending txs, logs, new heads).
3. [enhanced-apis.md](references/enhanced-apis.md) - Alchemy-enhanced RPC methods that reduce RPC call count.
4. [utility-api.md](references/utility-api.md) - Convenience endpoints like bulk transaction receipts.
5. [debug-api.md](references/debug-api.md) - Debug tracing for transaction simulation and execution insight.
6. [trace-api.md](references/trace-api.md) - Trace-level details for internal calls and state diffs.

## How to Use This Skill
- Start with `references/json-rpc.md` for base connectivity and request patterns.
- Use `references/enhanced-apis.md` for wallet/asset analytics on EVM without scanning logs.
- Use Debug/Trace when you need internal call trees or detailed execution flow.

## Cross-References
- `data-apis` skill for higher-level asset analytics.
- `webhooks` skill for event-driven flows.
- `operational` skill for auth, limits, and reliability.
